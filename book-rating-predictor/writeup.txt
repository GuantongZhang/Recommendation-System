For the read prediction, I first created a negative training set, which is similar to the negative validation set we have created in Homework 3. Then, I used an unbalanced logistic regression model which class_weight ratio is 1:1.78. I chose four features: a) the average rating of the user, b) the number of books read by the user, c) the average rating of the book, and d) the total time of reads of the book.

For the category prediction, I considered the bag of word, the bigrams, and the trigrams. Also, I used Jaccard similarities between the words in text and the words of most frequent words in each of the categories. With these features, I used a logistic regression model with C=7 to predict the category of a certain book.
